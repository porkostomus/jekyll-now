title: 4clojure 125 - Gus' Quinundrum
---

Create a function of no arguments which returns a string that is an exact copy of the function itself. 

Hint: read this if you get stuck (this question is harder than it first appears); but it's worth the effort to solve it independently if you can! 

Fun fact: Gus is the name of the 4Clojure dragon.

<pre><code class="language-klipse">(ns live.test
  (:require [cljs.test :refer-macros [deftest is run-tests]]))
  
(deftest test-125
  (is (= (str '(fn [x] (str x x))
              '(fn [x] (str x x)))
         ((fn [x] (str x x))
          '(fn [x] (str x x))))))
  
(run-tests)
