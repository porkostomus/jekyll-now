title: 4clojure 124 - Analyze Reversi
---

[Reversi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) is normally played on an 8 by 8 board. In this problem, a 4 by 4 board is represented as a two-dimensional vector with black, white, and empty pieces represented by 'b, 'w, and 'e, respectively. Create a function that accepts a game board and color as arguments, and returns a map of legal moves for that color. Each key should be the coordinates of a legal move, and its value a set of the coordinates of the pieces flipped by that move.

Board coordinates should be as in calls to get-in. For example, [0 1] is the topmost row, second column from the left.
