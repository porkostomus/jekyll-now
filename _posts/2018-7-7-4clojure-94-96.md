## 94 - Game of Life

The [game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. 

The 'board' consists of both live (#) and dead ( ) cells. Each cell interacts with its eight neighbours (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), and its next state is dependent on the following rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function that accepts a board, and returns a board representing the next generation of cells.

; 96 - Beauty is Symmetry

; Let us define a binary tree as "symmetric" if the left half of the tree is the mirror image of the right half of the tree. Write a predicate to determine whether or not a given binary tree is symmetric. (see To Tree, or not to Tree for a reminder on the tree representation we're using).
