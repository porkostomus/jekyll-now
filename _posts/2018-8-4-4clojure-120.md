title: 4clojure 120 - Sum of square of digits
---

Write a function which takes a collection of integers as an argument.
Return the count of how many elements are smaller than the sum of their squared component digits.
For example: 10 is larger than 1 squared plus 0 squared; whereas 15 is smaller than 1 squared plus 5 squared.
