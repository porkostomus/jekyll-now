title: 4clojure 128 - Recognize Playing Cards
---

A standard American deck of playing cards has four suits - spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs - 
and thirteen cards in each suit.
Two is the lowest rank, followed by other integers up to ten; then the jack, queen, king, and ace.

It's convenient for humans to represent these cards as suit/rank pairs, such as H5 or DQ:
the heart five and diamond queen respectively.
But these forms are not convenient for programmers,
so to write a card game you need some way to parse an input string into meaningful components.
For purposes of determining rank, we will define the cards to be valued from 0 (the two) to 12 (the ace)

Write a function which converts (for example) the string `"SJ"` into a map of `{:suit :spade, :rank 9}`.
A ten will always be represented with the single character `"T"`, rather than the two characters `"10"`.
