title: 4clojure 127 - Love Triangle
---

Everyone loves triangles, and it's easy to understand why—they're so wonderfully symmetric (except scalenes, they suck). 

Your passion for triangles has led you to become a miner (and part-time Clojure programmer) where you work all day to chip out isosceles-shaped minerals from rocks gathered in a nearby open-pit mine. There are too many rocks coming from the mine to harvest them all so you've been tasked with writing a program to analyze the mineral patterns of each rock, and determine which rocks have the biggest minerals. 

Someone has already written a computer-vision system for the mine. It images each rock as it comes into the processing centre and creates a cross-sectional bitmap of mineral (1) and rock (0) concentrations for each one. 

You must now create a function which accepts a collection of integers, each integer when read in base-2 gives the bit-representation of the rock (again, 1s are mineral and 0s are worthless scalene-like rock). You must return the cross-sectional area of the largest harvestable mineral from the input rock, as follows: 

* The minerals only have smooth faces when sheared vertically or horizontally from the rock's cross-section
* The mine is only concerned with harvesting isosceles triangles (such that one or two sides can be sheared)
* If only one face of the mineral is sheared, its opposing vertex must be a point (ie. the smooth face must be of odd length), and its two equal-length sides must intersect the shear face at 45° (ie. those sides must cut even-diagonally)
* The harvested mineral may not contain any traces of rock
* The mineral may lie in any orientation in the plane
* Area should be calculated as the sum of 1s that comprise the mineral
* Minerals must have a minimum of three measures of area to be harvested
* If no minerals can be harvested from the rock, your function should return nil
